# striptest
A small script to find optimal tempo settings for f/stop printing with a metronome in the darkroom
## Background

When working in the darkroom, I usually think in f/stops and use a metronome on 60 bpm to time my teststrips and other exposures. I used to manually calculate each exposure with $t=b\cdot 2^{\text{stop}}$
